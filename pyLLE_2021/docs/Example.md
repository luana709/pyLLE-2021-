This example is accessible through a Jupyter notebook available in the [example folder](https://github.com/gregmoille/pyLLE/tree/master/example). The use of Jupyter based on the convenience of its interactivity, but obviously one can script pyLLE and use an ipython console or a python bash command, where one would use *matplotlib* instead of *plotly*. Check the [documentation of the module](https://gregmoille.github.io/pyLLE/pyLLE.html) for the difference in output in both cases.

Please make sure you also checked if the installation when without any problem by checking out the [installation page](https://gregmoille.github.io/pyLLE/installation.html)



## Import and Setup

In a python shell, spyder, a script, or in  jupyter notebook, start by importing the package.


```python
import pyLLE
```

We now define the resonator parameters. Here we will use a file _TestDispersion.csv_ which is made of two columns: the first one is the azimuthal mode order (integer), the second is their corresponding frequency of resonance in Hz.


```python
res = {'R': 23e-6, # ring radius in meter
       'Qi': 1e6,  # Intrinsic Q factor
       'Qc': 1e6,  # Coupled Q factor
       'γ': 1.55,  # Non-linear coefficient at the pump frequency
       'dispfile': 'TestDispersion.csv', # frequency and corresponding azymuthal mode simulated previously
      }
```

We now define the simulation parameters. Here we precise a linear detuning ramp of the pump from **&delta;&omega;\_init** to **&delta;&omega;\_end** relative to the pump mode angular frequency, mode closest to the defined pump frequency **f\_pmp**. The simulation length **Tscan** is in unit of round trip, as it is more convenient in the Lugiato-Lefever formalism. It is important to notice that two parameters for the mode bandwidth have to be defined, **&mu;\_fit** which determined the fit window of the raw data found in **dispfile**, and **&mu;\_sim** which is the number of mode simulated in the LLE, hence could be larger than the fit mode through extrapolation


```python
import numpy as np
sim = {'Pin': 150e-3, # Input power in Q
       'Tscan': 1e6,  # Length of the simulation in unit of round trip
       'f_pmp': 191e12, # Pump Frequency
       'δω_init': 2e9*2*np.pi, # Initial detuning of the pump in rad/s
       'δω_end': -8e9*2*np.pi,  # End detunin of the pump in rad/s
       'μ_sim': [-74,170],  # azimuthal mode to simulate on the left and right side of the pump
       'μ_fit': [-71, 180], # azimuthal mode to fit the dispersion on the left and right side of the pump
        }
```

In both the resonator and simulation dictionaries, the parameters can be called through their greek letters or through their equivalent latin names (_e.g._ &mu;&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;mu or &delta;&omega;&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;deltaomega). A translator dictionnary is implemented to translates every greek entries (see. self.\_greek)

---

Let's initialize the class


```python
solver = pyLLE.LLEsolver(sim=sim,
                       res=res,
                       debug=False)
```

Using the option _debug=False_ is important especially on windows where a bug is still hapening due to coing of the greek characters, resulting in a crash of the solver.

## Dispersion Analysis

To plot and retrieve all the dispersion data, the method _self.Analyze_ has to be called, resulting in the plot of the integrated dispersion Dint

```python
solver.Analyze(plot=True,
               plottype='all')
```

Here, we extrapolate (orange curve - _LLE simulation_) outside of the spectral window containing the raw dispersion data (blue dots), to enable a simulation over a broader spectral range. One has to be carefull about using this extrapolation feature, as ripples in the integrated dispersion can result, creating zero-crossings which are artefacts that will influence the LLE simulation results.

---

A new attribute _disp_ has been created, and consists of a dictionary of the different values of the retrieve dispersion.

## Temporal Solver

One can solver the full temporal Lugiato Lefever equation

$$
\begin{align*}
t_R \frac{\partial E(t, \tau)}{\partial t} = &- \left(\frac{\alpha'}{2} - i\delta_0 \right)E + \\ &i \cdot \mathrm{FT}^{-1}\left[ -t_R D_{int}(\omega) \cdot \mathrm{FT}\left[E(t, \tau)\right]\right] +\\& L \gamma|E|^2 E + \sqrt{\eta}E_{in}
\end{align*}
$$


The solver implemented in this package is based on a Julia core called through python. Hence, to interface to both languages in an easy way, a hdf5 file is created in a temporary location with all the necessary data to solve the above LLE.

<br>

To solve the LLE, we first need to set up the file:

```python
solver.Setup()
```

And now we can solve the equation

```python
solver.SolveTemporal()
```

If the user stops the solver (most of the time through a ctrl-c command), the Julia solver will be killed, and hence won't use too much CPU resources.

---

When done, we need to retrieve the data:

```python
solver.RetrieveData()
```

---

Once done, one can plot a figure which summarize the evolution of the comb with the detuning using

```python
solver.PlotCombPower()
```

Here, we have an overall indication of the behavior of the system through a 2D plot of the comb power vs. frequency and LLE step (top), a 2D plot of the comb power vs. fast time and LLE step (middle), and a 1D plot of the comb power vs. LLE step (bottom).

## Post Processing of the Temporal Solver

ere is a list of different method that ease the plotting of the quantity of interest, such as comb spectra and envelop of the electric field regarding the fast time. Although this is quite convenient for most of applications, one could use the raw complex electric field within the resonator. The different quantities saved by the solver are can be retrieved in the dictionary `solver.sol`


```python
solver.sol.keys()
```

Everything in the `solver.sol` dictionarry is in SI units, except for the comb power, which is in dBm.

- `solver.sol['u_probe']`, is the complex electric field relative to the fast time within the cavity, hence the complex number, probed by the solver. It is a matrix 1000 x [number of µ solved]
- `solver.sol['Em_probe']` is the FFT of `solver.sol['u_probe']`, hence the complex spectra of the electric field. The comb spectra, within the cavity is given bu $10\times\mathrm{log10}(\mathrm{abs}(\mathtt{Em\_probe})^2)$ From Em_probe, it is easy to find the output comb power, given by Em_probe*sqrt(&eta;), where &eta; (in the Julia solver), is the coupling rate to the waveguide, given by Q<sub>c</sub>
- `solver.sol['Ewg']` corresponding to $\mathtt{solver.sol['Em\_probe']}\times\sqrt{\eta}$, hence the complex spectra envelop of the electric field at the output of the coupled waveguide.
- `solver.sol['detuning']` is the detuning ramp used
- `solver.sol['ω']` is the angular frequency
- `solver.sol['ω']` is the optical frequency
- `solver.sol['theta']` is the position within the cavity, in radian (between -π and +π).


It is import to note that all these quantity are subsampled in regards of the split-Fourier total step taken. Indeed, the number of step to solver the temporal LLE would be to large to efficienlty save or display the results. Hence, we subsample the steps taken by the solver at a fix number of **1000** (hence why the different matrices have a size of 1000x [number of µ solved])

### Displaying Results

To have a better idea of what is happening for a given laser-cavity mode detuning, we can plot the spectrum and the temporal profile of the electric field in the resonator at a fixed LLE step:

```python
ind = 540
_ = solver.PlotCombSpectra(ind)
```

The temporal profile can also be retrieved, which can be interesting, for example, in the case when we are on a soliton state for the given detuning:

### Saving figures

Helper routines to save the figures in any format supported by matplotlib have been created. The helper (pylle.\_llesolver\_Latexify) has been designed to make “publication-ready-like” figures, while one is using jupyter notebook/jupyter lab (hence relying on plotly for figure display) or through a python console (hence through matplotlib display). Depending on which type of plot has already been displayed (comb summary, comb spectra, time profile), these figures will be saved in the specified format.

```python
solver.SavePlots2File(basename = 'images/', format = 'pdf')
solver.SavePlots2File(basename = 'images/', format = 'png')
```

### Pickling the Solver

The whole package has been design with simplicity in mind, which means not only simplicity to compute, but also simplicity to retrieve results. Hence pyLLE is coded in a way that, using the pickle package, one can easily save the state of the solver and retrieve it later, with all the features presented above still available. It is important to use the self.SaveResults method to pickle the solver as it takes care of dumping the different threads that cannot be pickled in the class.

```python
solver.SaveResults('PickleSolver', path = './')
```

One can reload the state of the simulation:

```python
import pickle as pkl
oldSolver = pkl.load(open('PickleSolver.pkl', 'br'))
```

The different methods can be called with the loaded pickled solver

```python
figly = oldSolver.PlotCombSpectra(570)
```

### Steady State Solver

One can solve the steady state Lugiato Lefever equation :

$$
\begin{align*}
&- \left(\frac{\alpha'}{2} - i\delta_0 \right)E + i \cdot \mathrm{FT}^{-1}\left[ -t_R D_{int}(\omega) \cdot \mathrm{FT}\left[E(t, \tau)\right]\right] +\\
& L \gamma|E|^2 E + \sqrt{\eta}E_{in} = 0
\end{align*}
$$

Using a Newton's method to find the root of the equation will result in solving this particular state of the LLE.

The method self.SolveSteadySteate is designed for this. Although, it gives fast results, the accuracy of such a solver remains questionable compared to a full temporal resolution of the equation (in particular, the convergence of the Newton's method is not always assured).

---

First we need to change the simulation parameters to introduce a fix detuning _δω_

```python
solver.sim['δω'] = -5e9*2*np.pi # more or less what it is as the end of the soliton step
```

```python
steady_fig = solver.SolveSteadyState()
```
